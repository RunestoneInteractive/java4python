            Welcome to <em>Java for Python Programmers</em>.
            This short ebook is an ongoing project to help Computer Science students who have had one or two semesters of Python learn the Java programming language.
            If you are not a part of that audience you may still find this a useful way to learn about Java.
            This book is written using the build on what you know philosophy.
            In order to help you learn Java I will start with a Python example and then implement the example in Java.
            Along the way we will examine the strengths, weaknesses and differences between those two languages.
        </p>

        <p>
            This book does not attempt to replace the many good Java reference books that are available, in fact Dr. Miller used to use this in his course along with <url href="https://horstmann.com/corejava/index.html" visual="https://horstmann.com/corejava/index.html">Cay Horstman&#x2019;s &#x201C;Core Java&#x201D; volumes</url>.
            Please feel free to use this book for yourself, or if it fits a class you are teaching you are welcome to use this as a resource for your own class.

                Brad Miller started writing this article in 2006 using Python&#x2019;s restructured text.
                In 2007 I switched to markdown since everything else he was writing used markdown.
                In particular he switched to the variant of markdown used by the excellent <url href="https://pandoc.org/" visual="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</url> program.
                Pandoc does an excellent job of converting markdown to html, latex, pdf, and other formats.
   
                Finally, the document became so big that Brad used <c>pandoc</c> to convert it to latex for preparing the final version.
                He used The <c>htlatex</c> program to generate html for an online version of this document.
            </p>

                Brad Miller founded Runestone Academy in 2011 during a sabbatical from Luther College, and the original versions of this book was written in ReStructuredText.
