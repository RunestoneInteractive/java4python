    <title>Introduction to Java for Python Programmers</title>

        <p>
            This book assumes that you are already familiar with the <url href="http://www.python.org" visual="http://www.python.org">Python</url> programming language.
            We will use Python as a starting point for our journey into <url href="http://java.sun.com" visual="http://java.sun.com">Java</url>.
            We will begin by looking at a very simple Java program, just to see what the language looks like and how we get a program to run.
            Next, we will look at the main constructs that are common to most programming languages:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>

        <p>
            Once we have the basics of Java behind us we will move on to look at the features of Java that are both unique and powerful.

    <title>Java Development Environment</title>

    <introduction>
        <note>
          <p>
            Thank you to Beryl Hoffman for contributing to this section from her CSAwesome: AP Java Programming book.
          </p>
        </note>
      
        <p>
            The tool that we use to compile a Java source file into a Java class file
            is called a <term>compiler</term>. Most programmers use an
            <term>Integrated Development Environment</term> (IDE) that has the
            compiler built in and helps you write, compile, run, and debug programs.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can learn Java by just using the interactive coding panels called
            <term>Active Code</term> in this e-book. If you are logged in, the Active
            Code will remember your changes and even show you a history of your
            changes to the code if you click on Load History.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, it’s a good idea to also try a Java IDE to build code outside of
            this e-book, especially to try coding with user input which Active Code
            cannot do. There are many Java IDEs available.
        </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-java-ide-options">
        <title>Java IDE Options</title>
        <p>
      There are a lot of online cloud IDEs where you can code online in many
      programming languages. Most are free to start, but offer different
      features for a price. These are great options if you are using a
      Chromebook or you cannot install software on your computer or you want an
      easy no-installation option. Some of the Active Code samples in this
      e-book also include a link to online IDEs. These projects can be copied to
      make your own copy.
    </p>

    <p>Here are some popular online IDEs:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            CodeHS (<url href="https://codehs.com/"
            >https://codehs.com/</url>) has a free Sandbox online IDE 
            (<url href="https://codehs.com/app/sandbox">https://codehs.com/app/sandbox</url>) 
            where you can run Java and Java Swing programs. Students can share the links 
            to their code and the history of their code is saved. CodeHS has free and paid features.
            Grading features are in the paid version.
          </p>

            PickCode (<url href="https://pickcode.io/"
            visual="https://pickcode.io/">https://pickcode.io/</url>) is another
            online IDE that offers many free and paid features for setting up
            classrooms. In the free version, tudents can share links to their code and 
            the history of their code is saved. Classroom features are in the paid version.
          </p>

            Replit (<url href="https://replit.com/"
            visual="https://replit.com/">https://replit.com/</url>) an online
            IDE which recently switched to only allowing 3 projects at a time
            for free. Be aware that Replit has turned on its AI feature for code
            completion for all accounts (<url href="https://replit.com/ai"
            visual="https://replit.com/ai">https://replit.com/ai</url>). Each
            user can turn the AI on and off at the bottom of the code window,
            and use an AI chat window to ask questions of the AI.

            JuiceMind (<url href="https://juicemind.com/"
            visual="https://juicemind.com/">https://juicemind.com/</url>) is an
            online IDE that offers many free and paid features for teachers to
            set up classrooms like Coding Rooms. It has a built-in version of
            CSAwesome.

    <title>Github Classroom and Codespaces</title>
    <p>
      Github provides many free opportunities for students and teachers (<url
      href="https://docs.github.com/en/education/quickstart"
      visual="https://docs.github.com/en/education/quickstart">https://docs.github.com/en/education/quickstart</url>).
      Github Classroom (<url href="https://classroom.github.com/"
      visual="https://classroom.github.com/">https://classroom.github.com/</url>)
      allows teachers to set up a classroom based on github repositories. Github
      and git are both widely used in the computer industry, so learning to use
      them is great experience for students. Github now has a cloud IDE called
      Codespaces (<url href="https://github.com/features/codespaces"
      visual="https://github.com/features/codespaces">https://github.com/features/codespaces</url>)
      which you can use for 60 hours a month for free or completely free if you
      join as a school or get approved as a teacher or student. In Codespaces,
      you can start from a blank template or a repo, open a .java file in the
      VSCode editor, follow prompts to install the Extension Pack for Java,
      click on the Run and Debug (play button), follow the prompts to install
      the Java debugger, and see the output of your code in the terminal. You
      can also use Copilot (<url href="https://github.com/features/copilot"
      visual="https://github.com/features/copilot">https://github.com/features/copilot</url>),
      which is a coding AI based on GPT, for free if you are approved for
      educational use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Students will need to sign up for a free Github account (<url
      href="https://github.com/signup"
      visual="https://github.com/signup">https://github.com/signup</url>) if
      they don’t already have one in order to use Codespaces.

      VSCode (<url href="https://code.visualstudio.com"
      visual="https://code.visualstudio.com">https://code.visualstudio.com</url>)
      is a widely used coding editor which you can download on your local
      computers. It has many useful extensions. The code can be run in a
      terminal window in the editor. See <url
      href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java"
      visual="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java</url>
      for Java support. This editor is different than Microsoft Visual Studio
      which is a very large IDE.

      DrJava (from <url href="http://DrJava.org"
      visual="http://DrJava.org">http://DrJava.org</url>) is a free, simple,
      easy to install and use development environment. One nice feature is the
      interactions pane at the bottom which lets you try out Java code without
      having to create a class first.

      jGRASP (<url href="https://www.jgrasp.org/"
      visual="https://www.jgrasp.org/">https://www.jgrasp.org/</url>) is a free
      lightweight development environment, created specifically to provide
      automatic generation of software visualizations. jGRASP is implemented in
      Java, and runs on all platforms with a Java Virtual Machine (Java version
      1.5 or higher). jGRASP produces Control Structure Diagrams (CSDs) for
      Java, C, C++, Objective-C, Python, Ada, and VHDL; Complexity Profile
      Graphs (CPGs) for Java and Ada; UML class diagrams for Java; and has
      dynamic object viewers and a viewer canvas that work in conjunction with
      an integrated debugger and workbench for Java. The site includes both
      intro video and PDF tutorials.
