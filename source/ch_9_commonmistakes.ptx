    <section xml:id="forgetting-to-declare-your-variables">
        <title>Forgetting to declare your variables</title>
        <p>
            In Python, you can use a variable without declaring it first, but in Java, you must declare all variables before using them.
            If you try to use a variable that has not been declared, the Java compiler will give you an error message like this:
        </p>
        <program language="java" interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes">
            <code>
            import java.util.ArrayList; // Line 1: Import necessary class

            public class Main { // Line 3: Class declaration
                public static void main(String[] args) { // Line 4: Main method declaration
                
                    count = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&lt;(10); // Line 6: Attempt to use 'count' without declaration

                    System.out.println("ArrayList created."); // Line 8: This line won't be reached due to the error.

                } // Line 10: End of main method
            } // Line 11: End of class    
        </code>
        </program>
        <p>
            The 'cannot find symbol' error for the variable <c>count</c> on line 6 indicates that <c>count</c> was used before it was declared within the <c>Histo</c> class. In Java, all variables must be explicitly declared with a data type (e.g., <c>int</c>, <c>String</c>, <c>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</c>) before they can be assigned a value or referenced in any way. The arrow in the error message points to where the undeclared variable <c>count</c> was first encountered. To resolve this, <c>count</c> needs to be declared with its appropriate type (e.g., <c>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; count;</c>) before any attempt to initialize or use it.
        </p>

    <section xml:id="not-importing-a-class">
        <title>Not importing a class</title>
        <program language="java" interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes">
            <p>
                In Python, many classes are available by default. However, in Java, you must explicitly import most classes from external packages that you want to use.
            </p>
            <code>
            // Histo.java
            public class Histo { // Line 2: Class declaration

                public static void main(String[] args) { // Line 4: Main method declaration
                    
                    Scanner data = null; // Line 6: This line will cause the "cannot find symbol" error

                } // Line 8: End of main method
            } // Line 9: End of class
        </code>
        </program>
        <p>
             You may notice that this error message looks similar to the previous one, however, it has an entirely different cause. In Java, classes like <c>Scanner</c> that are part of external packages (like <c>java.util</c>) must be explicitly imported into your source file. Java does not automatically recognize these classes. To resolve this error, you need to add an import statement for the <c>Scanner</c> class at the beginning of your <c>Histo.java</c> file, typically import <c>java.util.Scanner;</c>.
        </p>

    <section xml:id="forgetting-to-use-the-new-keyword-to-create-an-object">
        <title>Forgetting to use the new keyword to create an object</title>
        <p>
            Unlike Python, where you can create a new object without explicitly using a keyword, Java requires the <c>new</c> keyword to instantiate a new object.
        </p>
        <program language="java" interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes">
            <code>
                // Histo.java // Line 1: The filename for this example
                import java.io.File;    // Line 2: Import the File class, needed for file operations
                import java.util.Scanner; // Line 3: Import the Scanner class, now correctly imported

                public class Histo { // Line 5: Class declaration

                    public static void main(String[] args) { // Line 7: Main method declaration
                        
                        Scanner data = Scanner(new File("test.dat")); // Line 9: This Line will cause an error

                    } // Line 12: End of main method
                } // Line 13: End of class
            </code>
        </program>
        <p>
          This error message occurs when you forget to use the <c>new</c> keyword to instantiate an object. 
          Specifically, on line 8 of <c>Histo.java</c>, <c>data = Scanner(new File("test.dat"));</c> leads to a 'cannot find symbol' error. 
          While the message states 'symbol: method Scanner(File)', this can be misleading. 
          Java incorrectly interprets <c>Scanner()</c> as an attempt to call a static method named <c>Scanner</c> within the <c>Histo</c> class 
          (or an inherited one). However, <c>Scanner</c> is a constructor of the <c>Scanner</c> class, not a standalone method, 
          and therefore requires the new keyword (e.g., <c>data = new Scanner(new File("test.dat"));</c>) to create a new <c>Scanner</c> object.

    <section xml:id="forgetting-a-semicolon">
        <title>Forgetting a Semicolon</title>
        <p>
            A common mistake in Java is to forget that every statement must end with a semicolon (<c>;</c>).
        </p>
        <program language="java" interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes">
            <code>
            // Histo.java
            import java.util.Scanner; // Line 1
                                        // Line 2
            public class Histo {         // Line 3
                                        // Line 4
                public static void main(String[] args) { // Line 5
                    Scanner data = null    // Line 7: The error will point here
                    System.out.println("This line will not compile."); // Line 8
                }
            }
        </code>
        </program>
        <p>
            The error "';' expected" on line 7 of <c>Histo.java</c> means that a semicolon is missing at the end of the statement <c>Scanner data = null</c>. In Java, every statement must be terminated with a semicolon (<c>;</c>) to indicate its completion. The arrow points to <c>null</c> because that's where the compiler expected to find the semicolon.
        </p>

    <section xml:id="forgetting-to-declare-the-kind-of-object-in-a-container">
        <title>Forgetting to declare the kind of object in a container</title>
        <p>
            Java is a statically typed language, meaning you must specify the type of objects that can be stored in a container like an <c>ArrayList</c>. If you forget to declare the type, the compiler will give you an error.
        </p>
        <program language="java" interactive="activecode" line-numbers="yes">
            <code>
                // UncheckedWarningDemo.java 
                import java.util.ArrayList; // Line 2: Import the ArrayList class

                public class UncheckedWarningDemo { // Line 4: Class declaration

                    public static void main(String[] args) { // Line 6: Main method declaration

                        // This is where the potential for unchecked operations begins.
                        ArrayList rawList = new ArrayList();//Line 9

                        rawList.add("Hello");//Line 11: This is the line that will throw an error

                        System.out.println("Element added: " + rawList.get(0));
                    } // Line 14: End of main method
                } // Line 15: End of class
            </code>
        </program>
        <p>
            This is a compiler warning, not an error, indicating a potential type safety issue. It occurs because you are calling the <c>add()</c> method on <c>rawList</c>, which is an <c>ArrayList</c> used as a raw type (i.e., without specifying a generic type like <c>&lt;String&gt;</c> or <c>&lt;Integer&gt;</c>).
        </p>
                
        <p>
            When <c>ArrayList</c> is used as a raw type, the compiler cannot guarantee the type of elements being added or retrieved, leading to "unchecked" operations. The <c>E extends Object</c> part refers to the generic type parameter <c>E</c> that <c>ArrayList</c> should have, which defaults to <c>Object</c> when the type is not specified, making the <c>add()</c> call unchecked. This can lead to <c>ClassCastExceptions</c> at runtime if incompatible types are later retrieved and cast.
