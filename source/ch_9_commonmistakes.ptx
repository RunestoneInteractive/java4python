        <p>
            The 'cannot find symbol' error for the variable <c>count</c> on line 7 indicates that <c>count</c> was used before it was declared within the <c>Histo</c> class. In Java, all variables must be explicitly declared with a data type (e.g., <c>int</c>, <c>String</c>, <c>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;</c>) before they can be assigned a value or referenced in any way. The arrow in the error message points to where the undeclared variable <c>count</c> was first encountered. To resolve this, <c>count</c> needs to be declared with its appropriate type (e.g., <c>ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; count;</c>) before any attempt to initialize or use it.

        <title>Not importing a class</title>

        <p>
             You may notice that this error message looks similar to the previous one, however, it has an entirely different cause. In Java, classes like <c>Scanner</c> that are part of external packages (like <c>java.util</c>) must be explicitly imported into your source file. Java does not automatically recognize these classes. To resolve this error, you need to add an import statement for the <c>Scanner</c> class at the beginning of your <c>Histo.java</c> file, typically import <c>java.util.Scanner;</c>.
        </p>

            Histo.java:3: error: cannot find symbol
                Scanner data = null;
                ^
              symbol:   class Scanner
              location: class Histo

    <section xml:id="forgetting-to-use-the-new-keyword-to-create-an-object">
        <title>Forgetting to use the new keyword to create an object</title>

        <p>
          This error message occurs when you forget to use the <c>new</c> keyword to instantiate an object. 
          Specifically, on line 8 of <c>Histo.java</c>, <c>data = Scanner(new File("test.dat"));</c> leads to a 'cannot find symbol' error. 
          While the message states 'symbol: method Scanner(File)', this can be misleading. 
          Java incorrectly interprets <c>Scanner()</c> as an attempt to call a static method named <c>Scanner</c> within the <c>Histo</c> class 
          (or an inherited one). However, <c>Scanner</c> is a constructor of the <c>Scanner</c> class, not a standalone method, 
          and therefore requires the new keyword (e.g., <c>data = new Scanner(new File("test.dat"));</c>) to create a new <c>Scanner</c> object.

        </p>
